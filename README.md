## Omurice

**My way:**

- Prep:

  - Cook around 1 serving of rice (0.75-1.5 cups of rice)
  - Mince garlic (2-4 cloves)
  - Dice 1/3-1/2 of an onion (save the leftovers for later)
  - Dice a carrot (optional)
  - Crack two eggs, add a little bit of milk, and whisk them.
    - Add salt and pepper to taste.

- Cooking the fried rice:

  1. Preheat the pan with high heat.
  2. Turn down the heat to medium high heat once the pan is hot and put in oil.
  3. Put in the garlic and cook for 15-30 seconds (make sure they're not overcooked)
  4. Put in the onions. Cook until onions are clear. Feel free to turn down the heat if you feel that the pan is too hot.
     1. Move the onions around occassionally to prevent burning.
     2. You can put in carrots in this step too.
     3. If you're good, flip the pan contents like this dude in his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_nosb-2mX4).
  5. Put in the rice.
  6. Add in 1 tbsp of soy sauce and 2 tbsp of ketchup.
  7. Mix (turn down heat if too hot or rice is burning) and add salt/pepper to taste.
  8. Clean the pan or make a sauce with the extra stuff.

- Cooking the omelette:

  - Don't overcook it, just go slow.
